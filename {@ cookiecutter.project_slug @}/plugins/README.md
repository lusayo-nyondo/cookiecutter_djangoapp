# Themer Plugins

This uses DJP to add apps to the webapp without having to touch the core configuration files.
It's very convenient and necessary to set up pluggable behavior.

It is not a package as each plugin's definition is strictly imported from a single .py file.

Might add to it later by forking or contributing to djp at: [DJP](https://github.com/simonw/djp).
